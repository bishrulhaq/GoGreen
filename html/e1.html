<h3>Why it's Important to Become Environmentally Friendly</h3>
<p>
You can't just point towards one business or practice and blame them for all of our environmental woes, everything fits together like a puzzle. The more that we all do our part â€“ the faster we will create an entire ecology of living that promotes sustainability. The first step is to begin to understand the basics of what each part of life can do to become more environmentally friendly. The next step is to begin to learn to make different choices on a personal level that start to change your awareness, and consumption of resources. The changes are surprisingly easy to make, there are more ways than you can imagine to begin to practice conservation.
</p>
<h3>The Environmentally Friendly Community</h3>
<p>
In the environmentally friendly community there is more than just a good recycling program in place. Communities that are committed to conservation and preservation of resources work to encourage options like community playgrounds, public transportation, green construction and work to change the way that fossil fuels and other resources are used to support community services.
</p>
<h3>The Environmentally Friendly Person</h3>
<p>
The environmentally friendly person is the person who moves through life with an awareness of how natural resources are used to create and support the life that they live. They recycle, conserve water and fuel and make other choices that not only lessen their impact on the environment, but also support industries that are working towards being more environmentally responsible.
